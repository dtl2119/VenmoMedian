# VenmoMedian
Calculating the rolling median degree of a graph generated by incoming Venmo Payments

Project:
Build a graph using payments between Venmo users as edges.  The graph should
only consist of payments within a 60-second sliding time window -- any payments
outside of this window should be removed from the graph.  After each processed
payment, the graph is updated, and the median degree of all verticies should
be calculated.

Instead of using the Venmo API to stream payments, we will take an input file with
JSON messages where each line represents a transaction.


#Usage:   src$ python rolling_median.py <path_to_input_file> <path_to_output_file>
#Example: src$ python rolling_median.py ../venmo_input/venmo-trans.txt ../venmo_output/output.txt


Pre-built modules:
Though I tried to import as few modules as possible, I did use a few:
import json - To parse the json messages into the 3 fields (created_time, actor, target)
import datetime - To convert the raw time from the input file to a unix timestamp
import bisect - To insert timestamps into an already sorted list
